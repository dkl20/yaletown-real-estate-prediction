**Yaletown Real Estate Price Prediction**

This project developed a predictive pricing model to estimate apartment prices in Yaletown, Vancouver, using a dataset of 100 listings and multiple linear regression. By analyzing key property features such as interior floor space, building age, and parking availability, the model achieves an adjusted R² of 79.71%, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy.

**Results:**

Ŷ = 132118.055 + 1013.327X1 − 4805.501X2 + 66083.745X5

Where:

X1 = Interior Floor Space (Sq Ft)

X2 = Age of Building (Years)

X5 = Number of Parking Spots

**Example Use-Case**

Ŷ = 132118.055 1013.327(700) - 4805.501(15) + 66083.745(1) = $835,448.19

For an apartment in Yaletown with 700 square feet, in a 15-year old building, and one parking spot, the estimated average price is $835,448.19.
